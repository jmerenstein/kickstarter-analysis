# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
The goal of this project is to utuilze Kickstarter campaign data to help assist Louise reach her fundraising goal for her upcoming play, "Fever." I am utilizing the avaiable Kickstarter campaign data to help Louise figure out how much she should ask for, what time of year she should ask for it, and how previous Kickstarter campaigns for plays have fared. 

## Analsyis and Chanllenges: 
The first part of the anaylysis to help Louise was to figure out if different Kickstarter campaigns for plays did better or worse based on the date that they were launched. To accomplish this I created a Pivot Table from the available Kickstarter campaign data to sort it based on how successful theater campaign outcpmes were based on what date during the year they were launched. The pivot table is located [here](https://github.com/jmerenstein/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx) and is under the worksheet titled "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date." The results of that Pivot Table analysis can also be found in the graph here [here](https://github.com/jmerenstein/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theaters_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png). The main challenge of this analysis was to decide if I should just look at theater Kickstarter campaign or Kickstarter campaigns overall. Since, Louise is looking to fund her play I decided it would be best to just look at theeater campaigns

The second part of the analysis consisted of looking at how much money the kickstarters would have as their fundraising goals and then seeing what different dollar amount ranges led to successful, failed, or canceled Kickstarter campaigns. To do this I used the COUNTIFS function in Excel to figure out how many succesful, failed, and canceled campagins asked for certain goal amounts. Then I took the percentages of the succesful, failed, and canceled campaigns for those different goal amounts to see what a good suggestion of a goal amount would be for Louise. The line graph showing those different percentages can be seen [here](https://github.com/jmerenstein/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theaters_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
